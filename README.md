# Web elements
Web elements is a collection of components designed with scratch CSS using different design languages.

## How to use
All styles are available for usage and customization on your own projects. You can obtain the styles from the CSS stylesheet of the design language you want to have and use them directly on your projects. The preview (html) page is also a kind of documentation to that design language. All used class names, customization options and all other necessary details are explained in them.

## Structure
The basic structure is based on folders. Every folder contain the files for a single design language and a README file which briefly explains the design language and the files themselves. 

### html folder
The html folder has the most basic style, using plain HTML and CSS styles and are the base file for other design languages. Other folders use these files as base to themselves and updates made to the contents of this folder should also be synced with all other folders.
