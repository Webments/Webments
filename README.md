# Webments
Webments is a collection of components designed with scratch CSS using different design languages.

## How to use
All frameworks are available for usage and customization on your own projects. You can obtain the styles from the CSS stylesheet of the design language you want to have and use them directly on your projects. The preview (html) page is also a kind of documentation to that design language. All used class names, customization options and all other necessary details are explained in them.

## Structure
The basic structure is based on repositories. Every repository contain the files for a single design language and a README file which briefly explains the design language and the files themselves. 

### HTML folder
The HTML repository has the most basic style, using plain HTML and CSS styles and are the base file for other design languages. Other repositories use these files as base to themselves and updates made to the contents of this folder are also synced with other repositories (e.g. main.css).
