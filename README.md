## Structure

The basic structure is based on repositories. Every repository contain the files for a single design language and a README file which briefly explains the design language and the files themselves.

### HTML folder

The HTML repository has the most basic style, using plain HTML and CSS styles and are the base file for other design languages. Other repositories use these files as base to themselves and updates made to the contents of this folder are also synced with other repositories (e.g. main.css).
